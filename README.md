# weather-planner

## Description 

This project was created to allow a user to search a city and receive weather data. The project displays both the current weather of the city and a five day forecast.
The city that was searched becomes a button that the user can click in the future to look directly at that city's weather information. It is important to be able to look at the weather for various locations to be able to plan one's day and travels accordingly.  

The most difficult part of this project was to set up the local storage for the cities.  I kept having an error when I started due to the array value being null and not being able to add the first item to the array.
After some research I figured out to set the arrays first value to the city if the array's current value is null and push all other items to the array once values are already in the array itself.


## Installation

To utilize the project, open in your internet browser.


## Usage 

The project provides the user a method to search the weather of various cities throughout the world.  The user inputs a city and the weather data is displayed on the screen.
Past searches are present as buttons the user can also click to view the cooresponding weather.
